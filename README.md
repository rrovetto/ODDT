# The Orbital Debris Decision Tree ( ODDT )

Welcome to the Orbital Debris Decision Tree (ODDT)--the worldâ€™s first workflow for answering key questions about space debris, including ownership, origins, characterization, categorization, responsibility, and actionable decisions. It provides a visual, high-level, user-friendly, decision-support process for space actors and stakeholders. _From Detection to Disposal_, the space debris decision tree will help the global spaceflight community address the hazards of orbital debris. Contact to collaborate on the next version, and future papers.

From Detection to Disposal, global astronautics has many open questions about orbital debris.

- Is it debris? (How do we identify a satellite as debris?)
- Who owns it? Where did it come from?
- Can it be actioned?
- What do we do it?
- Who may/should remove debris?
- How do we remove it?
  
ODDT provides a structured process for answering these questions. It's a decision-support workflow and high-level procedure that technical and non-technical stakeholders can follow for collaborative solutions to the risk posed by orbital space debris.

The ODDT moves us from from satellite detection to action (or inaction), asking questions of identity, origination, ownership, capability, and responsibility. It uses a preliminary set of qualitative criteria to categorize an orbital space object as debris or non-debris.

The connection between questons and answers puts us in a better position to better understand more complex questions such as: What legal and policy mechanisms must be in place to remove a debris? How does it related to national security concerns, dual-use, export controls, and other aspects of the space domain.
